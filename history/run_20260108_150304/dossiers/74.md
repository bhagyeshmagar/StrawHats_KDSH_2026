>  Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages." "They have done wrong," said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. "I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power." "Listen," continued Kai-Koumou. "Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken."

"Probably," said Glenarvan. "And with what horrible death do you threaten us?" inquired Lady Helena. "The death of the sacrilegious, my friends," continued Paganel. "The avenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them." "What! you would make a vo...

>  under cover of the night. But since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to abandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent plan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a flight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances might indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a transaction; but still it was better to await the result. What, moreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed savages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe had lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to recover; and he was not mistaken. The next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness. It stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which w...
