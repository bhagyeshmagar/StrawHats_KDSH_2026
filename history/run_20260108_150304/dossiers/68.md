> At ten, migrating with his clan, a flame-shaped birth-mark on his forehead convinced elders he was the reincarnation of the “sun-devouring warrior.” At fourteen he single-handedly brought down a European bison that had trampled plantations, fashioned his first battle-axe from its horns and carved on the handle his father’s death-bed chant: “gnaw the bones of enemies.”

>  under cover of the night. But since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to abandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent plan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a flight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances might indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a transaction; but still it was better to await the result. What, moreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed savages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe had lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to recover; and he was not mistaken.

>  the Indian with a questioning look. [Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.] "The horns come from the ground," explained Thalcave; "and the cattle are under it." "What!" cried Paganel, "is there a whole drove in this mire?" "Yes," answered the Patagonian. In fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way beneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by side, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which sometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the Indian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed around this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most exacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was far behind. Thalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of thing...
