>  Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on deck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. "Can I be released from attending this tribunal?" asked Lady Helena. "I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate would be very painful to me." "It is only to confront him, Helena," replied Glenarvan. "Remain, if you can.

They feared every moment that the wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him.
