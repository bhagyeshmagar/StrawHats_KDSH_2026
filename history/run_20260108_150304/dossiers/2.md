> 's repast, which was declared excellent and even superior to the splendid banquets of the Pampas. Paganel called twice for every dish, "through absent-mindedness," as he said. This unfortunate word led Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally shown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each other with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised "upon his honor" not to commit a single blunder during the entire voyage. He then in a very comical way told the story of his mistake in the study of Spanish. "After all," he added, in conclusion, "misfortunes are sometimes beneficial, and I do not regret my error."

"He does not understand," said the geographer. "Perhaps you do not pronounce well," replied the major. "Very true! Curse the pronunciation!" And again Paganel began, but with no better success.
