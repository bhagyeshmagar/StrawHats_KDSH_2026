>  Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages." "They have done wrong," said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. "I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power." "Listen," continued Kai-Koumou. "Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken."

> Let us go down," cried he, "before our only way of escape is blocked up." But just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them, and said: "It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!" And all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the movements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted. Their ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious interdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and halted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.
