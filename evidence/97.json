I feel cramps over my whole body.” “Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?” “Yes.” “Any noise in the ears?” “Frightful.” 40112m “When did you first feel that?” “Just now.” “Suddenly?” “Yes, like a clap of thunder.” “Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?” “Nothing.” “No drowsiness?” “None.” “What have you eaten today?” “I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master’s lemonade—that’s all.” And Barrois turned towards Noirtier, who, immovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him. “Where is this lemonade?” asked the doctor eagerly. “Downstairs in the decanter.” “Whereabouts downstairs?” “In the kitchen.” “Shall I go and fetch it, doctor?” inquired Villefort. “No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.” D’Avrigny bounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and almost knocked down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself going down to the kitchen. She cried out, but d’Avrigny paid no attention to her; possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four steps with a bound, and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter, where it had been left. He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey. Panting with loss of breath, he returned to the room he had just left. Madame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room. “Is this the decanter you spoke of?” asked d’Avrigny. “Yes, doctor.” “Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?” “I believe so.” “What did it taste like?” “It had a bitter taste.” The doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand, put his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace. “It is no doubt the same,” said he. “Did you drink some too, M. Noirtier?” “Yes.” “And did you also discover a bitter taste?” “Yes.” “Oh, doctor,” cried Barrois, “the fit is coming on again. Oh, do something for me.” The doctor flew to his patient. “That emetic, Villefort—see if it is coming.” Villefort sprang into the passage, exclaiming, “The emetic! the emetic!—is it come yet?” No one answered. The most profound terror reigned throughout the house. “If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs,” said d’Avrigny, looking around him, “perhaps I might prevent suffocation. But there is nothing which would do!—nothing!” 40114m “Oh, sir,” cried Barrois, “are you going to let me die without help? Oh, I am dying! Oh, save me!” “A pen, a pen!” said the doctor. There was one lying on the table; he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who, in the midst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them. This second attack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from the couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. The doctor left him in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it, and, going up to Noirtier, said abruptly: “How do you find yourself?—well?” “Yes.” “Have you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light and comfortable—eh?” “Yes.” “Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?” “Yes.” “Did Barrois make your lemonade?” “Yes.” “Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?” “No.” “Was it M. de Villefort?” “No.” “Madame?” “No.” “It was your granddaughter, then, was it not?” “Yes.” A groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d’Avrigny; he left M. Noirtier, and returned to the sick man. “Barrois,” said the doctor, “can you speak?” Barrois muttered a few unintelligible words. “Try and make an effort to do so, my good man.” said d’Avrigny. Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes. “Who made the lemonade?” “I did.” “Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?” “No.” “You left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?” “Yes; I left it in the pantry, because I was called away.” “Who brought it into this room, then?” “Mademoiselle Valentine.” D’Avrigny struck his forehead with his hand. “Gracious heaven,” exclaimed he. “Doctor, doctor!” cried Barrois, who felt another fit coming. “Will they never bring that emetic?” asked the doctor. “Here is a glass with one already prepared,” said Villefort, entering the room. “Who prepared it?” “The chemist who came here with me.” 40116m “Drink it,” said the doctor to Barrois. “Impossible, doctor; it is too late; my throat is closing up. I am choking! Oh, my heart! Ah, my head!—Oh, what agony!—Shall I suffer like this long?” “No, no, friend,” replied the doctor, “you will soon cease to suffer.” “Ah, I understand you,” said the unhappy man.",
